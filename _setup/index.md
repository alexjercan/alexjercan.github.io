# Dev Setup ðŸ’»

Welcome to the *basement*, a place where you will learn how to maximize
productivity with Linux. In this section we will look into my custom Linux
setup. Here you will learn how to use the terminal, how to make a great editing
experience with neovim and how to jump between terminal sessions with tmux.

- [My neovim setup](/setup/neovim)
- [My tmux config](/setup/tmux)

This section assumes you are using a linux distro. Personally, I am using
Ubuntu ðŸ—¿.
