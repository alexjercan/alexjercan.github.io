# Dev Setup 💻

Welcome to the *basement*, a place where you will learn how to maximize
productivity with Linux. In this section we will look into my custom Linux
setup. Here you will learn how to use the terminal, how to make a great editing
experience with neovim and how to jump between terminal sessions with tmux.

Check out how I have configured my linux setup for a smooth development
experience. I will keep the posts updated with my latest changes.

- [My editor setup](/setup/editor) - see how I set up my Tmux and NeoVim

# Tutorials 🎓

Tutorials for beginner projects. I will cover different topics, like AI and CLI
tools. This section assumes you are using a linux distro. Personally, I am
using ~~Ubuntu 🗿~~ Arch 🤓 (BTW).

interesting and consider that helped me learn something new in security
challenges.

frameworks to learn new and interesting skills. I will usually try to implement
very simple games in JavaScript or Python and CLI tools in C or Rust.
