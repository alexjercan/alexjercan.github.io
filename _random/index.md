# Random Projects ðŸ“¦

Random projects where I experiment with different programming languages and
frameworks to learn new and interesting skills. I will usually try to implement
very simple games in JavaScript or Python and CLI tools in C or Rust.

- [Escape the Labyrinth](/random/labyrinth-escape) - Plain JavaScript Game
  where You Need to find the Exit of a Maze
- [Race AI](/random/race-ai) - Plain JavaScript Racing Game that includes an AI
- [CodeHint](/random/codehint) - NeoVim Plugin for suggesting Hints for Bugs in
  Code
- [Fried YouTube](/random/fried-youtube) - Meme CLI Tool that is used to
  combine to videos in the TikTok style
- [Slide Gen](/random/slide-gen) - CLI Tool that uses Generative AI to create a
  slideshow presentation
- [Habit Tracker](/random/habit-tracker) - SvelteKit Website that you can use
  to track daily habits
- [CodeHint WebApp](/random/codehint-web) - SvelteKit Website that makes
  CodeHint more friendly to use
- [Falling Blocks](/random/falling-blocks) - My first game, made in C# in an
  old Visual Studio
