# About

Implementation of Data Structures in C.

This repository contains:
- vector: useful when a simple C [] array is needed but without the hassle of
  reallocating when needed
- array: is an ArrayList like implementation can append elements to a growing C
  [] array
- queue: is a Linked List FIFO
- hashmap: is a constant size vector of buckets where each element is a key
  value pair with custom hash and equals methods

This repository also contains hashing functions that can be used for any data
structure.

# Usage

```console
make && ./main
```
