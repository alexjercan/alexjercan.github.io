# About

This game is an endless runner where the main character must avoid the spikes
at the top and also falling down. You must always stay on the pipes. You can
move around using the arrow keys.

This project started off as a proof of concept of make random pipes on the
screen, hence the name, but it evolved in a game that I used to play on an old
Nokia phone. (The game was something like

# Technologies

I have build this game a while back, but I have used C# and Windows Forms. I
was able to run it on Linux using wine. And surprisingly it worked first try.
You just have to be careful with the window size, because I did not take that
into account :)

# Conclusion

This was just a fun project to find on an old USB drive and wanted to save it
somewhere safer :)

This is also part of a repo that contains multiple projects I build around the
same time.
