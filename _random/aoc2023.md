# About

Advent of Code 2023 in Haskell. Follow the development of this on
<https://github.com/alexjercan/aoc-2023>. This blog post will contain my notes
on solving each day and explanations for the solutions.

# Quickstart

To download the puzzle inputs, copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and
fill in the session with your cookie from the aoc website. Then you can run

```console
./get
```

To run one day in particular you can run

```console
make Day%
```

where `%` is the day number with 2 digits (01, 02, ... 20, 21)

For more information on the usage you can also check out the github repository.

# Solutions

I will solve each day of AoC in Haskell and post each one on this page.
