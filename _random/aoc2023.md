# About

Advent of Code 2023 in Haskell. Follow the development of this on
<https://github.com/alexjercan/aoc-2023>. This blog post will contain my notes
on solving each day and explanations for the solutions.

# Quickstart

To download the puzzle inputs, copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and
fill in the session with your cookie from the aoc website. Then you can run

```console
./get
```

To run one day in particular you can run

```console
make Day%
```

where `%` is the day number with 2 digits (01, 02, ... 20, 21)

For more information on the usage you can also check out the github repository.

# Solutions

I will solve each day of AoC in Haskell and post each one on this page.

**Day 1** - For the first part it is enough to scan trough all the characters
and choose which ones are digits. Then you just need the first and the last.
Combine them into the numbers and add them. But for the second part you also
need to find digits made up of strings, which is more difficult. To be fair, I
think that this first day of AoC was harder than previous years, but it was
still a fun problem. My idea was to generate all the suffixes of the string and
find what digit, if any, starts in the beginning of it. So basically I just
generated all the digits, as before, but took into account the names too. Then
I took the first one and the last one and did the same as for part 1. But I
struggled to implement this idea in Haskell, because I was using the `tails`
and `isInfixOf` functions wrong. I tought that tails generates the tail of the
list in the same way as inits does, and starts from the empty list, but it
actually goes the other way around. I found this out after like 20 minutes of
banging my head againts the wall, but it is what it is. Then I tought that
`isInfixOf` only matches the start of the string, but I should have used
`isPrefixOf`. Small mistake, I blame ChatGPT for that. Anyway, while working
for the solution for the second part, I realized that you can also solve part 1
with the same approach, but you just ignore the digit names. So yeah, my final
solution is just changing up this `tryToDigit` function depending on which part
you need to solve.
