# About

[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Haskell. Follow the
development of this on <https://github.com/alexjercan/aoc-2023>. This blog post
will contain my notes on solving each day and explanations for the solutions.

# Quickstart

To download the puzzle inputs, copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and
fill in the session with your cookie from the aoc website. Then you can run

```console
./get
```

To run one day in particular you can run

```console
make Day%
```

where `%` is the day number with 2 digits (01, 02, ... 20, 21)

For more information on the usage you can also check out the github repository.

# Solutions

I will solve each day of AoC in Haskell and post each one on this page.

**Day 01** - For the first part it is enough to scan trough all the characters
and choose which ones are digits. Then you just need the first and the last.
Combine them into the numbers and add them. But for the second part you also
need to find digits made up of strings, which is more difficult. To be fair, I
think that this first day of AoC was harder than previous years, but it was
still a fun problem. My idea was to generate all the suffixes of the string and
find what digit, if any, starts in the beginning of it. So basically I just
generated all the digits, as before, but took into account the names too. Then
I took the first one and the last one and did the same as for part 1. But I
struggled to implement this idea in Haskell, because I was using the `tails`
and `isInfixOf` functions wrong. I tought that tails generates the tail of the
list in the same way as inits does, and starts from the empty list, but it
actually goes the other way around. I found this out after like 20 minutes of
banging my head againts the wall, but it is what it is. Then I tought that
`isInfixOf` only matches the start of the string, but I should have used
`isPrefixOf`. Small mistake, I blame ChatGPT for that. Anyway, while working
for the solution for the second part, I realized that you can also solve part 1
with the same approach, but you just ignore the digit names. So yeah, my final
solution is just changing up this `tryToDigit` function depending on which part
you need to solve.

**Day 02** - Parsing... I kind of forgot how to do it, so I had to check my old
AoC in Haskell and steal it from there. But I am surprised I still remember a
lot of helper functions from parsec. Anyway, my idea was to create a small data
structure called `Game` that will hold the index and a list of `Round`s. The
round will be the RGB colors of the cubes. So I basically started with parsing
from the smallest block and then made my way up to the entire input. You can
go both ways, but I find it easier like this because of whitespaces. I want the
whitespaces to be dealt with in the higher level blocks. After we get the data
structure to parse it is really simple. We just need to check each color of the
round to be bounded by the numbers in the statement and we get the valid games.
Then for the second part, we just had to see what is the minimum number of
cubes required for each game to be able to be played. So we just need to look
for the maximum number in each game and that would be the bare minimum. So
yeah, took me 30 minutes to solve, but most of the time I spent on parsing, you
can also see that from the time it took to solve part 2 after part 1.

**Day 03** - Matrices... I always find them annoying in Haskell. However, I
don't think I have found myself in any rabit hole... it was a straightforward
solution. My idea was to go trough all the characters on the map, parse all the
numbers, then filter just the numbers that have an adjacent symbol and sum
them. For part 2 I also kept the position and the character of the symbol, then
filtered only gears and then used a hashmap to figure out which gears have 2
numbers (a hashmap from the position of the gear to the numbers that are next
to it) and then did the product and sum. It took me longer to solve just
because there was a lot more code to write. And in between the first part and
second one I took a short break. But I wouldn't say that this problem was hard.
All I can say is that it could have been worse. I liked how I managed to have a
really similar solution for both parts.

**Day 04** - Parsing numbers. This is something that is somewhat simple in
Haskell. Overall day 4 was easy. Sorting the two number lists and then
iterating them in parallel did the trick for counting the number of matches.
For the second part, my idea was to iterate the card matches once, and update
the number of cards. I used a fold and set the number of cards to be the
accumulator. Each time I get a new card, I use the existing number of matches
to determine how to update the accumulator. Basically just add the number of
cards to the following next matches. I lost like 10 minutes on a small bug, the
cards use 1 indexing, but I forgot that `(!!)` uses zero indexing. It is what
it is. Haskell is really hard to debug. Or at least I don't know a good way of
doing it. Also wasted some time on parsing. Even though parsing is easy in
Haskell, setting everything up takes some time.

**Day 05** - This was a pretty difficult day for me. Took me a lot longer than
usual. Got stuck for a while on the first part. I missed the `The destination
range is the same length`...`With this information, you know that seed number
98 corresponds to soil number 50 and that seed number 99 corresponds to soil
number 51.` and I almost did part 2 for part 1, thinking that this is a weird
DP problem :). After I figured out the trick I managed to solve part 1 pretty
quickly. It was just iterating the mappings. My fear was that there will be
mappings that overlap or that the range can be in multiple mappings at once.
For the first part it was fine, but for the second part the fear became a
reality. The idea for the second part was to extend the first function to work
on ranges. So instead of a single number you need to keep track of multiple.
Then I also kept track of the pre and post intervals just in case.

**Day 06** - This was a fun puzzle problem. I figured out that there must be a
way to solve it using a formula, and it was. The idea was to get the equation
right. First I tought well, we have the time `T` and distance `D`. Then, to get
some speed you need to hold the button, let's say that time is `t`. So the
speed is also `t`, but the remaining time is `T - t`. This means that the
distance we can travel is `(T - t) * t` and this needs to be larger than `D`.
So we have this equation `(T - t) * t > D` and we can do the quadratic formula
and get the roots for `t`. And the interval between `t1` and `t2` is where this
formula holds. This formula will give us the roots `-t^2 + T*t - D = 0`. We have
`a = -1`, `b = T` and `c = -D` so we have `t1,2 = (T +- sqrt(T^2 - 4D)) / 2`.
We get both `t1` and `t2` and then we need to apply `ceiling` on `t1` and
`floor` on `t2`. This is because we are interested in the `int` solutions. One
thing to be careful about is cases where you get `t1` or `t2` as `10.0` or
similar numbers. Those are the limits where the equation holds for `==`, so not
our case `>` and you need to add 1 or substract 1 more.

Overall it was not that difficult and it was fun to solve. Doable by hand LOL.

**Day 07** - This was a pretty fun day to solve. To be fair it was easier than
people predicted. So far even days were easy and odd days were harder. But this
one was at least interesting. So my idea was to sort all the hands. First I
didn't modify the strings and kept them as I read them, but then I realised
that it doesn't work because the 10, J, Q, K and A are not in order, so I
mapped them to some other letters, to be higher than all the numbers, but also
in order. To figure out what hand I have, I grouped the cards by value. It was
ok to do it like this, because we only care about pairs and not other special
BS. So yeah that was it for the first part. For the second part, I changed the
J card into a `0` to be the weakest and then did the same thing, but now also
looked at the number of jokers. Depending on it, it can increase the rank of a
hand. It was a bit painful to create the mapping, but that was because I was
trying to cut corners. Don't cut corners, just do the work once and do it well.
I would say that this problem was one of the easiest ones so far.

**Day 08** - When I saw the input, I thought that it's gonna be a graph
problem, which would have sucked because those are hard in Haskell. But it was
ok, I mean it was a map, but it was not a search. It was pretty straight
forward. I just had to implement a fold until, but that was not hard. Then for
the second part I figured right away that it was a lcm problem. Because in the
example `2 * 3 = 6`, but also because it is cycling, which makes sense. What
was nice was that the second part was totally different then the first part, so
IDK if someone would have guessed it. So yeah. I mean I was a bit thinking
about the fact that ZZZ still had options, but I mean... I didn't think much of
it. I wouldn't have guessed. I was maybe thinking of like some cycling for
part2 like maybe after how many steps it cycles. But wait. how did lcm work
tho? Like it is not guaranteed that it will cycle with LCM, but it did...
interesting. Well, I guess the map was made in such a way it will work, so it
is what it is. Still nice problem. It would be hard to solve it for real tho...
like if the map would not cycle. But it was a good one.

**Day 09** - For the first part I have notices that if you sum up all the last
elements of the diffs you get the prediction. For the second part I knew there
was something similar, but it doesn't look as good in my code. You have to
subtract from the current first element the accumulator. So for the example the
computation would look something like `(10 - (3 - (0 - (2 - (0))))) = 5`. This
was an easier day, even if it was a weekend day. Which is nice. The solution
was intuitive and the second part made sense. I would like to refactor the code
a bit and get it to look better. But I think it might not be possible to do
with a single function. Maybe I can use fold for both of them and use a folding
function for each part. That can work in some way. The easiest method is to
use a sum function and a diff function in the foldl so yeah. It is possible to
refactor.
