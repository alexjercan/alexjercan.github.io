# Distr

Distr is a CLI tool that I use to generate the HTML files for my blog.

It allows me to write C code in HTML files, which is then converted into a header file by distr.
Then distr itself includes this header file in the render function, which is used to render the HTML files.

Yes... I know this is the hackiest shit I could ever come up with, but it is pretty funny.
