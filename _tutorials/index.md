# Tutorials ðŸŽ“

Tutorials for beginner projects. I will cover different topics, like AI and CLI
tools.

This section assumes you are using a linux distro. Personally, I am using
Ubuntu ðŸ—¿.

### Dev Setup ðŸ’»

Welcome to the *basement*, a place where you will learn how to maximize
productivity with Linux. In this section we will look into my custom Linux
setup. Here you will learn how to use the terminal, how to make a great editing
experience with neovim and how to jump between terminal sessions with tmux.

Check out how I have configured my linux setup for a smooth development
experience. I will keep the posts updated with my latest changes.
