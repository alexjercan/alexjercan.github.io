# About

Building Neural Networks from scratch to understand the Math.

The dogs vs cats is a binary classification problem. The task is to classify an
image as a cat or a dog. The dataset I used can be found on kaggle
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data>.

Part 1 I explained the math behind feed forward and making predictions.

Part 2 I explained how the learning process works, and the math behind making
neural networks predict better.
